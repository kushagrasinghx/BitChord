 * cues the incoming track to [TransitionPlan.incomingCueTime] instead of 0,
 * stretches it by [TransitionPlan.incomingPlaybackRate] to align tempo, and
 * renders [TransitionPlan.transitionStyle] as filtering across the blend —
 * a closing low-pass over the outgoing track for [TransitionStyle.DJ_FILTER],

 * a low-end handover at [TransitionPlan.bassSwapFraction] for
 * [TransitionStyle.DJ_BLEND]. The gain curve underneath is equal-power in every
