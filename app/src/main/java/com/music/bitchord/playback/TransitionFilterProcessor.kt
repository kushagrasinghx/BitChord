/**
 * The filter a track rides through a Automix transition: a low-pass that can
 * close over the outgoing track, and a high-pass that can lift the low end out
 * of one side of a blend.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * [CrossfadeController] renders every transition as an equal-power gain blend,
 * and a gain blend is the one move that cannot fix the two things that actually
 * make a mix sound amateur:
 *
 *  - **Two basslines at once.** Below roughly 200 Hz a mix has very little room;
 *    two kick drums and two bass parts occupying it simultaneously read as mud
 *    and eat headroom, however carefully the gains are matched. Every DJ mixer
 *    ever built has a bass kill for exactly this, and the fix is the same here:
 *    the low end belongs to exactly one track at a time, and it changes hands
 *    once, on a beat the planner picked
 *    ([com.music.bitchord.playback.smart.TransitionPlan.bassSwapFraction]).
 *  - **Two unrelated tempi at once.** When the tracks are too far apart to
 *    beat-match, their transients simply collide. Closing a low-pass over the
 *    outgoing track pulls it behind the incoming one instead of leaving them to
 *    fight, which is why a filtered handoff is the standard move for a tempo
 *    change.
 *
 * ## The filter
 *
 * A topology-preserving (trapezoidal-integrator) state-variable filter, two
 * second-order sections cascaded to a 24 dB/octave Butterworth response. Chosen
 * over the more familiar Chamberlin SVF because the trapezoidal form is stable
 * at every cutoff up to Nyquist, while Chamberlin's is only well behaved below
 * about a sixth of the sample rate — a low-pass parked wide open at 20 kHz sits
 * far outside that, so the naive form would have to be special-cased at exactly
 * the setting it spends most of its time at.
 *
 * `tan` is evaluated once per sub-block rather than per sample, and the whole
 * thing degenerates to a buffer copy when both cutoffs are parked, so a
 * transition that asks for no filtering costs nothing.
 *
 * ## Gliding
 *
 * Cutoffs are targets, not values. [CrossfadeController] re-aims them once per
 * fade tick (every 30 ms), and stepping a filter in 30 ms jumps is audible as
 * zipper noise, so the real cutoff chases its target geometrically across
 * [GLIDE_FRAMES]-sample sub-blocks. Geometric because cutoff is perceived
 * logarithmically: a linear glide down from 20 kHz would spend nearly all of
 * itself inaudible and then lurch through the last octave.
