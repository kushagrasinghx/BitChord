 *    file a track corresponds to when asked to delete it.
 *
 * [saved] is a claim about a folder this app does not own. The user is expected
 * to manage Downloads with a file manager, so an entry here can outlive the
 * file it names — which is why every read of it goes through [savedUri], and

     * whatever album tag each row happened to carry — which an album page's rows
     * don't carry at all (the release is billed once, in the header) and a
     * playlist's rows *never* can, because a playlist is not an album and its
     * tracks are off forty different ones. So the thing the user tapped was the
     * one thing not written down anywhere.
     *
     * Recorded at the tap rather than on completion, and keyed by the id that
     * was tapped, so re-downloading the same release updates one entry instead
     * of accumulating near-duplicates. The order is the running order the page
     * had, which is what makes the entry read back as the release rather than as
     * a bag of tracks.
