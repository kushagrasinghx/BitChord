 * The audio thread used to call the decoder directly, and the decoder reads straight from the
 * network: a YouTube stream stops for a whole 512 KiB range request every half-minute or so, and a
 * lossless stream waits on its socket whenever the connection hiccups. WASAPI holds only a fifth
 * of a second, so any read slower than that was heard as a gap of a few milliseconds. Here those
 * waits land on this thread while the audio thread plays what was decoded earlier.
 *
 * Only this thread touches [source] once constructed — seeks and the close are handed to it — so
 * the native decoder never sees two threads.
