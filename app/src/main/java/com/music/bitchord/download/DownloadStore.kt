/**
 * Where a downloaded track goes, and how it gets there.
 *
 * The destination is the device's own Music folder, in a `BitChord`
 * subfolder — somewhere the file manager lists, other players can open, and a
 * user can back up or delete without going through this app. That choice is
 * what makes this class necessary at all: an app-private directory would be
 * four lines of [File], but a shared one crosses the scoped-storage line and
 * the two sides of that line have nothing in common.
 *
 * It goes through the audio collection rather than Downloads because that is
 * where audio belongs and where every other player on the device looks. What
 * first ruled Downloads out was narrower and is worth keeping on the record:
 * the files were `.webm` then — a container extension Android's own mime table
 * ties to video regardless of what MIME type this class declares for it — and a
 * Gallery app crawling Downloads for video-looking files does not care what a
 * column says otherwise. Nothing writes `.webm` any more (see [storable] and
 * `StreamResolver.resolveForDownload`), so that particular trap is behind us;
 * the conclusion it led to is still the right one.
 *
 *  - **API 29+** goes through [MediaStore]. There is no filesystem path to
 *    write to; the store mints a row, hands back a content uri, and the file
 *    exists at a location it chooses. `IS_PENDING` keeps the row invisible to
 *    everything else until the bytes are all there, so a cancelled download is
 *    never a half-file somebody can find and play.
 *  - **API 26–28** is a real path and a runtime permission. The file is written
 *    beside its final name with a `.part` suffix and renamed on completion,
 *    which is the same guarantee `IS_PENDING` gives for free above, and the
 *    media scanner is told afterwards or the file stays invisible to everything
 *    that reads the index rather than the disk.
 *
 * Neither side writes tags — this class only ever copies the bytes the server
 * on the other end sent. [MediaTagger] rewrites the finished file afterwards to
 * add them; the filename below is what every downloaded track carries
 * regardless of whether that rewrite finds a layout it recognises.
