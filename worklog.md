Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Port the ArchiveTune Appearance settings (the features shown in the
user's screenshots) into Neiro's Appearance settings page: Liquid Glass
customization (refraction, blur, tint, optical quality), random theme on
startup, Color Palette picker with a custom palette editor, App icon (moved
from Miscellaneous into Appearance, matching ArchiveTune's placement),
app-wide Hide status bar, UI scale, and Blur intensity. Dark theme ("Theme"),
disable-blur ("Reduce dynamic blur") and disable-animations ("Reduce
animation") already existed in birchord's own idiom and were left as they
were, as the equivalents of ArchiveTune's rows.

Work Log:
- Studied ArchiveTune's AppearanceSettings / LiquidGlassSettings /
  PalettePickerScreen / Theme.kt / App.kt and Neiro's SettingsSheet, Theme,
  LiquidGlass, MainActivity, AppSettings and player backdrop code first.
- data/theme/ThemePalettes.kt (new): the 64-palette catalog, ThemeSeedPalette
  and ThemeSeedPaletteCodec ported verbatim — same palette ids, colors and
  "seedPalette:"-prefixed base64 JSON preference format, so themes exported
  from ArchiveTune import here unchanged. generateRandomPalette keeps
  ArchiveTune's hue offsets.
- AppSettings: LiquidGlassIntensity enum plus ten Liquid Glass tuning flows
  (intensity, refraction height/amount, blur radius, tint opacity, shadow
  depth, 3D depth, chromatic aberration, backdrop vibrancy, adaptive
  luminance), colorPalette, randomThemeOnStartup, hideStatusBar (app-wide),
  uiScale (0.85..1.30) and blurIntensity (0..64 dp, 48 default), each with
  clamped setters; readAll() grows and stores a random palette on every start
  when random-theme is on, exactly as ArchiveTune's App init does.
- Theme.kt: BitChordTheme takes a seedPalette; the scheme is grown per-role
  from the four seeds (ArchiveTune's mergedSeedColorScheme structure) through
  materialkolor, added at 2.1.1 — the last line built against Compose 1.7,
  which is what this app's BOM resolves (ArchiveTune's 5.0.0-alpha07 needs
  Compose 1.11 / Kotlin 2.4). Palette style follows the seed's chroma
  (Monochrome / Neutral / TonalSpot) as in ArchiveTune.
- LiquidGlass.kt: LiquidGlassTuning ported — every control is a multiplier
  around the fixed values the app has always drawn, so the stock look is the
  default preset; refraction height/amount scale the lens, blur radius scales
  the frost, tint and adaptive luminance scale the surface fill, vibrancy
  gates the saturation boost, shadow depth scales the drop shadow.
- MainActivity: decodes the palette into BitChordTheme, provides a scaled
  LocalDensity (fontScale * uiScale, dp layout untouched, as in ArchiveTune),
  and composes the app-wide HideStatusBar beside the player's own.
  StatusBarIcons.android.kt's HideStatusBar now reference-counts so
  overlapping hiders (app-wide + player) don't fight over the window.
- Player blur intensity: PlayerSettingsSource.blurIntensity flows from
  AppSettings through AndroidPlayerHost into NowPlayingScreen;
  rememberFullArtworkBlurImage bakes the strength into its cache key and
  boxBlurred maps 48 dp to the blur the player has always drawn (same radius,
  three passes), widening/narrowing with the setting.
- SettingsSheet (Appearance group): a "Customize Glass" row under the Liquid
  Glass switch opens the new Liquid Glass choice page (intensity segmented
  control, five optics sliders, four optical-quality switches, reset);
  Random theme on startup switch; Color Palette row (shows the palette's
  name) opening the new palette page — live preview card drawn in a real
  BitChordTheme grown from the seeds, custom palette editor with per-role
  RGB/hex color dialogs and Apply, the 64-preset swatch grid, and
  import/export through the document picker; the App icon picker moved here
  from Miscellaneous; Hide status bar switch; UI scale and Blur intensity
  slider rows.
- strings.xml: 126 new strings (palette names, glass tuning, seed editor).

Stage Summary:
- Every default multiplies to exactly the stock look: no palette selected, no
  glass tuning touched, 48 dp blur, 100% UI scale, status bar visible — the
  app renders identically until a setting is changed. Pushed to main; CI
  (Check: testDevDebugUnitTest + assembleDevDebug) to be confirmed green.
